name: picture-it
description: Generate and edit images from the CLI using picture-it. Use this skill whenever the user asks to create, edit, or manipulate images — blog headers, social cards, hero images, product comparisons, YouTube thumbnails, movie posters, magazine covers, Instagram edits, background removal, or any visual content. Also trigger when the user mentions picture-it by name, wants to composite images, apply color grading, add text to images, remove or replace backgrounds, crop/resize photos, or needs any kind of image generation or photo editing from the terminal. This skill covers multi-pass AI image editing workflows that chain composable operations together.

# picture-it

Photoshop for AI agents. Composable image operations from the CLI.

## Prerequisites

picture-it must be installed and configured:

```bash
bun install -g picture-it
picture-it download-fonts
picture-it auth --fal <fal-api-key>
```

If not installed, tell the user to install it first. Get a FAL key from https://fal.ai.

## Core Concept

Every command takes an image in and outputs an image. Chain them to build anything. The agent calling picture-it IS the planner — there is no AI planner inside the tool.

## Commands Quick Reference

| Command | What it does | Needs FAL? |
|---|---|---|
| `generate` | Create image from text prompt | Yes |
| `edit` | Edit image(s) with AI | Yes |
| `remove-bg` | Remove background | Yes |
| `replace-bg` | Remove bg + generate new one | Yes |
| `crop` | Resize/crop to exact dimensions | No |
| `grade` | Apply color grading | No |
| `grain` | Add film grain | No |
| `vignette` | Add edge darkening | No |
| `text` | Render text onto image (Satori) | No |
| `compose` | Overlay images/text/shapes from JSON | No |
| `template` | Built-in templates (no AI) | No |
| `info` | Analyze image dimensions/colors | No |

## Model Selection

Choose the right model for the job — don't overspend.

**Generation (no input images):**
- `flux-schnell` ($0.003) — Default. Fast, good quality. Use for backgrounds and base scenes.
- `flux-dev` ($0.03) — Better quality. Use for hero images, portraits, detailed scenes where quality matters.

**Editing (with input images):**
- `seedream` ($0.04) — Default. Good for compositing multiple images, placing objects in scenes, adding text. Handles up to 10 inputs.
- `banana2` ($0.08) — Better image preservation. Use when you need the input image to stay more faithful, or >10 inputs.
- `banana-pro` ($0.15) — Best quality, best text rendering. Use for premium work, complex edits, character consistency.

**Background removal:**
- `bria` (default) — Best edge quality, clean cutouts
- `birefnet` — Good general purpose
- `pixelcut` — Alternative
- `rembg` — Cheapest

## How to Think About Composition

Read `references/composition-guide.md` for detailed techniques on creating professional compositions including text-behind-subject, multi-pass editing, and product photography workflows.

## Common Workflows

### Simple: Generate an image

```bash
picture-it generate --prompt "dark cosmic background with nebula" --size 1200x630 -o bg.png
```

### Simple: Add text to an image

```bash
picture-it text -i bg.png --title "Hello World" --font "Space Grotesk" --color white --font-size 64 -o hero.png
```

### Medium: Blog header with AI background + text

```bash
picture-it generate --prompt "abstract dark tech background" --size 1200x630 -o bg.png
picture-it text -i bg.png --title "My Blog Post" --font "DM Serif Display" --font-size 72 -o header.png
picture-it grade -i header.png --name cinematic -o header-graded.png
```

### Medium: Edit a photo background

```bash
picture-it edit -i photo.jpg --prompt "replace background with modern hotel entrance, keep subject identical" --model banana-pro -o edited.jpg
```

### Advanced: Text behind subject (YouTube thumbnail style)

```bash
# 1. Generate a scene
picture-it generate --prompt "runner on mountain trail at golden hour" --model flux-dev --size 1280x720 -o runner.png

# 2. Use FAL edit to add text BEHIND the subject
picture-it edit -i runner.png --prompt "Add 'RUN FASTER' in large bold black letters BEHIND the runner — the runner's body overlaps the text" --model seedream -o thumbnail.png
```

### Advanced: Product comparison with real photos

```bash
# 1. Remove backgrounds from product photos
picture-it remove-bg -i product-a.png --model bria -o a-cutout.png
picture-it remove-bg -i product-b.png --model bria -o b-cutout.png

# 2. Generate a background
picture-it generate --prompt "split gradient, blue left to orange right" --size 1200x630 -o bg.png

# 3. Compose cutouts onto background with text
picture-it compose -i bg.png --overlays overlays.json -o comparison.png
```

### Advanced: Multi-pass cinematic composition

```bash
# 1. Generate base scene
picture-it generate --prompt "dark stage with green spotlight" --model flux-dev --size 2048x1080 -o stage.png

# 2. Edit scene to place objects
picture-it edit -i stage.png -i logo.png --prompt "Place Figure 2 as glowing 3D cube in the spotlight" --model seedream -o composed.png

# 3. Post-process
picture-it crop -i composed.png --size 1200x630 --position attention -o cropped.png
picture-it grade -i cropped.png --name cinematic -o graded.png
picture-it vignette -i graded.png --opacity 0.3 -o final.png
```

## Platform Presets

Use `--platform <name>` with `generate` or `crop`:

| Preset | Size |
|---|---|
| `blog-featured` | 1200x630 |
| `og-image` | 1200x630 |
| `youtube-thumbnail` | 1280x720 |
| `instagram-square` | 1080x1080 |
| `instagram-story` | 1080x1920 |
| `twitter-header` | 1500x500 |

## Output Behavior

- **stdout**: only the output file path
- **stderr**: progress logs
- **Exit 0** on success, **Exit 1** on failure

Read stdout to get the file path. This is how you chain commands.

## Gotchas

- Always use `--model bria` for `remove-bg` — the default birefnet leaves rectangular artifacts that cause ugly glow/shadow halos when compositing.
- The `glow` effect in compose mode blurs the entire rectangular buffer, not the shape. Avoid using glow on cutout images — use the background color/lighting to create the glow effect instead.
- The `shadow` effect has the same rectangular artifact issue. For cutout images on clean backgrounds, skip shadows entirely.
- When editing with FAL, the model may alter product details (logos, text, design elements). For product images where accuracy matters, use `remove-bg` + `compose` instead of `edit` to preserve the original exactly.
- SeedDream takes ~60 seconds per generation. Don't assume it failed if it's slow.
- For `edit` with banana-pro, don't pass `resolution` or `limit_generations` params — it auto-detects.
- Always `crop` to exact dimensions after FAL generation — FAL models output approximate sizes.
- Use `flux-dev` ($0.03) not `flux-schnell` ($0.003) when image quality matters (hero images, portraits). The quality difference is significant.
- Satori does NOT support: display:grid, transforms, animations, box-shadow, filters. Use flexbox only.
- When adding text behind a subject with `edit`, be very explicit in the prompt: "the text is BEHIND the subject — the subject's body overlaps and partially covers the letters."
